# üöÄ BBB-Translation-Bot

**BBB-Translation-Bot** helps with communication in [BigBlueButton (BBB)](https://bigbluebutton.org/) meetings by providing **real-time transcription and translation**. The bot listens to the meeting‚Äôs audio, turns spoken words into text, and shows translations using a self-hosted version of [Whisper AI](https://github.com/openai/whisper) ([faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)) and [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/). It automatically adds the text as closed captions in BBB. üìùüåê

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Hardware:**
  - **GPU:** NVIDIA GPU. Im using a NVIDIA RTX 4090 ([More Info](https://www.nvidia.com/de-de/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/)) for stable transcription speed of ~2.1 seconds with Whisper large. If you are using a less powerful GPU, consider using a smaller model like Whisper base.
  - **Storage:** Minimum 64GB disk space (more recommended for active development as Docker can consume significant disk space).

- **Software:**
  - **Operating System:**
    - [Ubuntu 22.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/) or
    - Windows: [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with Ubuntu 22.04.
  - **Access:** Root access to your machine.

> **Tip:** Consider using [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/) to set up a virtual machine with Ubuntu 22 and enable GPU passthrough.

### üì• Clone the Repository

**DO NOT** clone sub repositories of the project in advance. The script depends on empty sub repositories and will clone them during the setup process. So pls follow the instructions below.

## ü™ü Windows WSL Setup

You can also develop on Windows using WSL2. Follow these steps:

1. **Install NVIDIA Drivers on Windows:**

    Download and install from [NVIDIA Drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/). According to the [WSL CUDA Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html#getting-started-with-cuda-on-wsl), WSL2 will access these drivers.

2. **Install WSL2:**

    Open PowerShell as an administrator and run:

    ```bash
    wsl --install
    ```

3. **Install Ubuntu 22.04:**

    - Open the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pn20msr04dw).
    - Search for **Ubuntu 22.04**.
    - Click **Install** and wait for the installation to complete.

4. **Install Docker Desktop:**

    - Download from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
    - Install and enable WSL2 integration.
    - Open the Ubuntu 22.04 terminal and verify Docker by running:

    ```bash
    docker
    ```

    **üîß Fix Docker Command Not Found Error:**

    <details>
      <summary>Solution: --> Click to expand <--</summary>

      If you encounter:

      ```bash
      $ docker
      The command 'docker' could not be found in this WSL 2 distro.
      We recommend activating WSL integration in Docker Desktop settings.

      For details, visit:
      https://docs.docker.com/go/wsl2/
      ```

      **Solution:**

      - Open Docker Desktop.
      - Go to **Settings** > **Resources** > **WSL Integration**.
      - Enable integration for **Ubuntu22**.
