# Why this model is here?

Normaly this model should be automatically downloaded from [link](https://whisperx.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/model_weights/segmentation/0b5b3216d60a2d32fc086b47ea8c67589aaeb26b7e07fcbe620d6d0b83e209ea/pytorch_model.bin). But since the link is not working, I have downloaded the model and uploaded it to the repository. This vad model was used in the [whisperx](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX).
